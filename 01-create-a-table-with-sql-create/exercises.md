# Create a Table with SQL Create Exercises 

All database's have recognized Types that are accepted. `Boolean` and `int` are two common types accepted in many relational database's such as Postgres or MySQL

Explore some of the types available to you [here](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/datatype.html).

Now that we have a `Users` table defined, create a `Products` table with different data types.

This table should have columns for: 
- `create_date` date for when the product is purchased
- `product_id` (hint: a unique identifier)
- `title` with a character limit of 50
- `description` Text that describes what the product is
- `price` money type for the purchase price



Take it a step further by adding a column for the user that purchased the product.
